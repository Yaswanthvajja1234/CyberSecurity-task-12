**CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
Task 12: Log Monitoring & Analysis (Practical)
Name: Yaswanth Vajja
Organization: Elevate Labs
Internship: Cyber Security Internship
Date: January 2026**
1. Introduction to Log Monitoring
Log monitoring involves collecting and analyzing system and application logs to detect security
incidents, suspicious behavior, and system issues. Logs are a key source of evidence during
incident response.
2. Types of Logs
Important log types include authentication logs, system logs, application logs, and security logs.
Each log type provides visibility into different system activities.
3. Tools Used
Logs from Linux systems, Windows Event Viewer, and SIEM tools such as Splunk (conceptual)
were considered for analysis in this task.
4. Practical Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze logs, identify failed login attempts, detect anomalies, and
correlate events for early incident detection.
5. Authentication Log Analysis
Authentication logs were analyzed to identify successful and failed login attempts. Multiple failed
attempts from the same user or IP can indicate brute-force attacks.
6. Identifying Failed Logins
Failed login events were filtered based on username, timestamp, and source IP address to detect
suspicious access patterns.
7. Anomaly Detection
Anomalies such as repeated login failures, unusual login times, and access from unknown IP
addresses were identified during log analysis.
8. Event Correlation
Related log events were correlated to understand the sequence of actions that may lead to a
security incident.
9. SIEM Basics
SIEM systems collect logs from multiple sources, correlate events, generate alerts, and help
security analysts detect and respond to incidents efficiently.
10. Alert Creation
Basic alert rules were defined for conditions such as multiple failed login attempts within a short
time period.
11. Documentation of Findings
All detected anomalies, alerts, and observations were documented to support incident investigation
and reporting.
12. Conclusion
This task improved understanding of log monitoring and analysis. Effective log analysis is essential
for detecting security incidents and strengthening organizational security posture.
